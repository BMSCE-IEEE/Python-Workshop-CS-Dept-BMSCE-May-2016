21/08/15, 10:38 PM - Rahul Kumar: An SIG (Special Interest Group) is by students and for students. It is not a workshop. Rather it is skill development course that goes on whole Sem. One class every week.

You can learn about the principles of Aerospace ( a new SIG started this year), or the basics of architecture and programming AVR of Microcontrollers, or learn a modern and general purpose programming language called Python ( with separate classes for people who know programming and those who are new to it.) 

So if you are interested, send in a application for an SIG of your choice.
Who knows, you may do projects in that field; or maybe, even teach it next time!

Open for both IEEE member and non members.

08/09/15, 8:41 PM - Omkar: In Japan, in a soap manufacturing company the soap blocks were made,
then wrapped in a wrapping paper automatically on an assembly conveyer belt
and finally packed in cartons...

Many a times it happened that the wrapping machine wrapped the paper without soap. i.e. you had an empty packet without soap.

To rectify this problem the Japanese company bought a X-ray scanner from the US for $60,000 to check on the  assembly line whether the container contained soap and wasn't empty.  


A similar problem happened at Nirma soaps, in Ahmedabad in INDIA.. Guess what they did????

They bought a bajaj fan costing around Rs.1500/- and placed it on the edge of the assembly line.
The empty wrappers, without soaps just blew away!!! 

😂😂😂

And You Say Japanese are Advanced in Technology.😝😝

We are 
INCREDIBLY
BRILLIANT INDIANS

02/10/15, 3:44 PM - Vaishnavi, CS BMSCE: V didn't start writing yet..
02/10/15, 10:42 PM - Vaishnavi, CS BMSCE: Engineers,
1) Amount of money spent on
photocopies over the
span of four years will be sufficient to
buy a brand
new Xerox machine.
2) When engineer says,"I cleaned my
room", he means
that he made a path from his door to
bed.
3) For every morning class before they
get out of their
bed, they calculate how much
attendance do they
have.
4) An engineer has girlfriend but she
lives in other
nation &that nation is"Imagination".
5) Their family members will not
consider them as an
engineer until & unless they don't
repair any of the
home appliances, no matter which
branch they
belongs to.
6) They do studies in the preparation
leave only, along
with making infinite resolutions about
the plan of their
daily studies in next semester.
7) If they are unable to convince
someone, then they
will surely confuse them.
The most inspiring quote for engineering
students
"Where there is a will there is a way,
After December there is May"
9) For them it is easier to stay awake till
6 AM, than to
wake-up at 6 AM.
10) To each &every twist in the question
paper, there
is equal &opposite twist in the answer
sheet given by
the engineers.

12/10/15, 2:30 PM - Shreedhar, CS BMSCE: Can u judge who is the better person out of these 3 ?

Mr A - He had frienship with bad politicians, consults astrologers, two wives, chain smoker, drinks eight to 10 times a day.

Mr B - He was kicked out of office twice, sleeps till noon, used opium in college & drinks whiskey every evening.

Mr C - He is a decorated war hero,a vegetarian, doesn't smoke , doesn't drink and never cheated on his wife.

You would want Mr.C rite.

But..
Mr. A was Franklin Roosevelt!

Mr. B was Winston Churchill!!

Mr C Was ADOLF HITLER!!!

Strange but true..
Its risky to judge anyone by his habits !
Character is a complex phenomenon.

So every person in ur life is important ,don't judge them ,accept them.
 Three beautiful thoughts

1. None can destroy iron, but its own rust can! 
Likewise, none can destroy a person, but his own mindset can.

2. Ups and downs in life are very important to keep us going, because a straight line even in an E.C.G. means we are not alive.

3. The same Boiling Water that hardens the egg, Will Soften the Potato!
It depends upon Individual's reaction To stressful circumstances!

Beautiful saying ---
Mobile has taught us three things ....
Whatever makes you happy -- save it.....
Whatever makes others happy -- forward it.....
Whatever will make no one happy -- Delete it....

U can't stop ur Laughter
.
.
If u can then do
.
.
Before the exam, pappu byhearted only one essay "My Friend"
.
.
But in exam the essay was "My Father"
.
.
But pappu didn't get much tension ... He thought for awhile and planned to write the essay replacing Friend As Father... So he wrote it.
But the teacher who corrected his paper is still unconsious !
.
.
Pappu Wrote i AM A VERY FATHERLY PERSON. I HAVE LOTS OF FATHERS .SOME OF MY FATHERS ARE MALE AND SOME ARE FEMALE. MY MOTHER IS VERY CLOSE TO MANY OF MY FATHERS. MY UNCLE IS ALSO MY FATHER. MY TRUE FATHER IS MY NEIGHBOUR. AND I LOVE ALL MY FATHERS BECAUSE EVERY PERSON MUST HAVE A FATHER.
.

Don't laugh alone, pass it to others too...😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

09/11/15, 7:13 PM - Sannidhi Mujumdar, CS BMSCE: When a child needs his father's time and father keeps his mobile away,switches off the tv and gives his 100 percent to child, that moment is DHAN for the child. When even after 20 years of wedding the husband still tells his wife ' I Love you '  and appreciate her for what she is with all honesty, those moments are DHAN for the wife. When  parents are old and they need attention and compassion from their children and when they get it, those moments are DHAN for the parents. May your life and world be filled with all such DHAN which makes our life truly worth living.
🙏 Happy Dhanteras!!🙏

17/11/15, 1:27 AM - Aa2: Can someone please post AVL trees notes
17/11/15, 9:00 AM - Shreedhar, CS BMSCE: Engineerng studnts...are all about

1) Amount of money spent on
photocopies over the
span of four years will be sufficient to
buy a brand
new Xerox machine.

2) When engineer says,"I cleaned my
room", he means
that he made a path from his door to
bed.

3) For every morning class before they
get out of their
bed, they calculate how much
attendance do they
have.

4) An engineer has girlfriend but she
lives in other
nation &that nation is"Imagination***".

5) Their family members will not
consider them as an
engineer until & unless they don't
repair any of the
home appliances, no matter which
branch they
belongs to.

6) They do studies only b4 d exm, along
with making 'infinite resolutions about
the plan of their
daily studies in next semester'.

7) If they are unable to convince
someone, then they
will surely confuse them.


The most inspiring quote for engineering
students
"Where there is a will there is a way"
"If not December, there is May"

9) For them it is easier to stay awake till
6 AM, than to
wake-up at 6 AM.😴

And d solid one👇🏼😜
10) To each &every twist in the question
paper, there
is equal &opposite twist in the answer
sheet😉😉
17/11/15, 9:02 AM - Shreedhar, CS BMSCE: 3rd one is so true 😛😝

13/01/16, 8:35 PM - Shashikant, CS BMSCE: A married couple got a letter through post. Inside that there were two complimentary first-class tickets of a new movie in the town's best cinema hall.

The following question was asked in that letter "Guess who sent this? Let's see whether you can identify it".

The couple put substantial effort to guess the sender's name but in vain.
Still, they watched the movie on the scheduled date and came back home.

They got shocked when they opened their house. All the expensive & valuable things were stolen. 

There was one letter in the house as well. After reading "By this time you should have identified who gave you the tickets" written in that letter, they yelled with anger...
"Oh God...! They are bloody robbers "..
.

20/01/16, 10:55 PM - Prashanth Muppalla, CS BMSCE: ABOUT BMSCE PLACEMENTS (sent in by Abhishek) ‪#‎MustRead‬ tongue emoticon

Hey guys, I'm from 8th sem ISE. I got placed after attending 50 companies. I don't want my juniors to struggle like me. So here's few advices I would like to give.😋

•Never study subjects for marks. You need to have strong basic knowledge in all the subjects. not jus one subject.

•Stop running behind GPA. 
If you have 8.5 and above, you can attend all the companies. 
If you have 8 and above you eligible for 90% of the companies. 
Above 7, you can atleast attend mass recruiters. 
If you have more than two backlogs, you have a tuff time in placements.

•Important subjects. 
C C++ Java DBMS OS UNIX
Whether you are in IS/CS or any other branch you have to learn these subjects. Every company loves asking these 6 subjects.

•Non IS/CS branches. 
Chances of you ppl getting into your core companies is very less. May be 10%. Rest all will end up in IT companies. So, atleast be strong in one programming language and one theory subject of IS/CS branch. 😕

•Lucky Bastards (IS/CS)
If BMSCE gets 150 companies, you will be eligible for 120+ companies. Everyone in the college will be jealous of you guys. 😈

•Top companies
Kirusa(20lakhs per annum)
Nutanix(19lpa)
Urban laddar(16lpa)
And another 20 companies above 10lpa. 😎

•Mass recruiters
IS/CS students, its advisable not to sit for these. it might take long time to get placed in non-mass recruiters. If you believe in yourself, you need not attend mass recruiters. If you don't want to take risk, you can attend it. Give chance for other branch guys to get placed no😜

•Tips to get placed in mass recruiters. 
Do not have more than one backlog. 
CGPA 7.5 and above. 
Strong communication knowledge. Strong aptitude skills. 
That's it. You will be placed😂

•Mass recruiters package
TCS(3.2lpa) -hired 230 students 
Accenture (3.5lpa)-150 students
Wipro(3.2lpa)-40 students.

•Start preparing
Every company will have their first round as Aptitude round. 
Practice verbal, non verbal and quantitative questions. If you don't clear this round, you can't get placed anywhere. 
Buy RS Agarwal book(Bible) 
www.indiabix.com
Start practicing from now itself. Remember, this is VERY VERY important.

•Coding 
whether you are in IS/CS or others,If you want higher package, you need to be strong in coding. Very strong
Practice in 
www.hackerrank.com
Codechef. Com
Hackerearth.com 
You want 10lpa and above, be strong in coding.

•My seniors nor lecturers gave us suggestions before. I'm giving you ppl now itself because I don't want you people to struggle for placements like me.

•BMSCE gets nearly 150 companies. You will get placed for sure. Have patience til the end and never lose hope. 😎

•Money is not everything. But for everything you need money. 
So its all about packages. Start preparing from now itself, you will get 15l or above package. If not, mass recruiters will pull you😂😂
That's all I wanted to say guys. I have helped you. Now it's your time to help others by sharing this message. 😊

All the best and good luck!

22/01/16, 4:59 PM - ‪+971 55 254 4444‬: Hola BMS! 
Got some exciting news for ya'll! The Red Bull Tourbus is back again. This time it's going to be bigger and better. About 8 months back, BMS witnessed one of the best gigs in India when Undying Inc, Parvaaz and our very own e-Swara project rocked the Bus after a whopping 13,000 votes came in for BMS.

This time Manipal is going to join the league and can be one tough competitor along with MSRIT and RV. I'm sure the BMS spirit will win it back. 
This time the bars are raised higher, we have a target of 20,000 votea and looking at a university - Manipal competing this time, we have one crazy task ahead. 

Voting begins on the 26th of January and all you need to do is give a "MISS CALL" on a number dedicated for BMS. And the links to the Redbull will also be open when you can vote online. Will be sharing the number soon. So gear up to vote and share the number!

 1. JNU students were protesting against the hanging of Afzal Guru. 

2. Afzal Guru was hanged during UPA govt. 

3. Rahul baba comes out in support of JNU students knowing that they were actually protesting against his parties decision. 

4. JNU students readily accept Rahul Baba's support also knowing that he is the representative of the govt who hanged Afzal. 

5. Innocent students....everyone seems happy. And who turns out to be the villain ?  
Modi. Now how's that possible?

When lights are off at night, one must not view the hand phone! (Smartphone)

Please share with family friends URGENTLY.....

Habitually using hand phones before bedtime in the dark can lead to serious problems.

Recently, an increasing number of 30-40 year-old patients are seeking medical attention due to using hand phones in the dark.

Professor Li Li, director of the Hospital of Ophthalmology SGH Singapore, said: direct glare of >30 minutes would cause irreversible eye macular degeneration that leads to rapid deterioration of vision.

Contracting maculopathy (eye cancer) means waiting for loss of sight because modern medicine cannot treat, let alone cure it.
The bright phone in the dark with close-up view high-energy directed at the eyes will damage the macula of the eye.

Professor Li Li said that symptoms of macular degeneration is mostly experienced by old people, but lately patients are getting younger. Patients who are 30-40 years of age increased by 3 %, most are frequent users of hand phones.

However, viewing the hand phone in the dark not only causes macular degeneration. It initially causes dry eyes, cataracts and eventually loss of sight.

Early lesions of the eye have to be treated with laser or injection of steroids.

254 Hospital eye specialist Professor Li Li suggested that the most important thing is to get rid of the bad habit of using hand phones in the dark. Because habitual use of hand phones in the dark before bedtime may cause a lifetime of harm.

Friends : In order to look after ourselves and our families, remember not to turn off the lights if viewing the hand phone. Inform hand phone users urgently that viewing hand phones in the dark can easily lead to loss of sight!

When it was time for offering, the offering plate was passed around.

Just then, the person behind me tapped me on the shoulder and handed me a Rs1000 note. I smiled, so generous. Then majestically, I looked around and put the Rs1000 in the plate and passed it on. Then I turned and thanked the man seriously for being so generous. He replied "don't mention'' 
be more careful next time,
 it fell from your pocket"
